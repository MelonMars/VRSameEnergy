VR INSPIRATION BOARD

This is a project to make an inspiration board based on images flying at you in 3d space, created by asking CLIP from OpenAI to label some images.

To run, go to `https://obj2gif.web.app`. you can then go to the canvas.

To run the backend, `cd` to the `backend`, and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then take all the images you want and place them into the `backend/images/` directory. Then run `python label.py` and then, to run the server, run `uvicorn search:app`. You will then see `INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)` (or something similar). Take the URL (in this case, `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), go to the settings of the VR, (press the cog icon or `s`) and then set the backend url to this. This will only work if you don't use a local url though, so DO NOT use something like `127.0.0.1`. Use something like `ngrok` if you have to (though it tends to be too slow).
